AwesomeDistanceCalculator gem, as its name indicates, it severs the purpose of calculating the distance between two given positions using the haversin formula.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'awesome_distance_calculator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install awesome_distance_calculator

## Usage

You could either use in you terminal for easy calculations by:

```shell
$ ./bin/console
```
and then:
```ruby
AwesomeDistanceCalculator::Harvesin.call([53.339428, -6.257664], [52.986375, -6.043701])
```
Or  also by including it in any wrapper/facade calculator class in your application
```ruby
class MyClass
    include AwesomeDistanceCalculator
end
```
That will add the `.calculate`method on your newly created class, so you could as follows:
```ruby
calculator = MyClass.new
calculator.calculate(coordinates: [[53.339428, -6.257664], [52.986375, -6.043701]])
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
